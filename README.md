## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a unique and user-friendly e-commerce website with a variety of features. It provides a seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases. Here are some key points about the project:


- **Product Management:** Users can add new products to the website through the "Add Product" page, which is a protected route. The form includes fields for adding product details such as image, name, brand name, type, price, short description, and rating. 

- **Brand-Based Shopping:** The website offers brand-specific pages where users can explore products based on their preferred brand. These pages include a slider with advertisements and product listings. A unique feature is that one of the brand types may not have any available products, and a relevant message will be displayed on that brand page.

- **Authentication and User Profiles:** The website implements email and password-based authentication, with a registration and login page. Users can toggle between these views. Additionally, there's an option to log in with an external account (e.g., Facebook, GitHub, Google). Once logged in, the user's name, profile picture, and a logout button will appear on the navbar for easy access.

- **My Cart:** Users can view and manage their added products in the "My Cart" page, which is also a protected route. They can remove items from their cart as needed.

- **Product Details:** Clicking on a product's "Details" button will take the user to a product detail page, displaying in-depth information about the product. Users can also add the product to their cart from this page.

- **Responsive Error Handling:** The registration and login pages feature responsive error handling. Password requirements and login errors are clearly communicated to users, either below the input fields or via alert/toast notifications.

- **404 Page:** The website includes a custom 404 page for handling not-found errors, ensuring a smooth user experience.
